Steps Followed : 
1) Load the date in Power Bi
2) After loading the data click on "Table View" check all the columns and rows and match the top and bottom rows with original file.
3) Visit Home >>> Click on "Transform Data" >>> Here we need to do little bit formatting and we can transform the data as per our needs.
   Like : a. Remove duplicate rows, b. Change the data types , c. Check the filters etc.
4) As per the problems and requirments we can Add measures to add on some clarity to the Dashboards.
5) Data Modeling : If there are more than one sheets (or tables ) we can built the connection between those tables and establish relationship between them.
6) After completing all the needful we need to comme back to report view to creating visuals .
7) We need to use "Card" visuals to perform Revenue , Quantity solt per item etc and
  "Multi Rows card" visuals to show : a) 'Maximum Sales done by Customes', b) Maximum numbers of products sold by customes etc.
8) "Line Chart" to perform the Trends over a period of time (like :  year wise, month wise etc)
9) We need to insert "Clustered column charts" to show comparison between region and catagories .
10) To show percentage of revenue done by region we can use "Pie Chart" to visualize the report.
11) And in the end we need to use "SLICER" on state and city to automatically update visuals, allowing real-time data exploration.
